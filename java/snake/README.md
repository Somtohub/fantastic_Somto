The game is tailored similarly to a game of snake using Java and will ensure that all rules obtainable in snake is available. The food will be displayed at random on the screen and the user would have to control the snake with the keypad. Any move outside the box or colliding with the body of the snake results in game over.
 The frame of the program was first created in the “Main” class, the Preferred size was set to a temporal value of (500, 500) which was later changed to (WIDTH, HEIGHT) as seen in the main class. The visibility was also set to visible in other to have a visible output at runtime. A restriction was also placed on the program to prevent the re-adjustment of the size of the program during runtime. This class also calls the SnakePanel class, which holds most of the instructions of the game.
 The last class created was the “SnakePanel” class. This class is responsible for the majority of the commands used in the game. The user input is validated using the “Key listener”, the food display is set to random while the snake is set to start in the middle and can only make the first move when the left, up or down key is pressed because the head of the snake is on the left. The SnakePanel interacts with the BodyPart class and stops when the game ends. The Total score and level are also displayed on the top left corner of the screen to show how many foods eaten by the snake already, and the level switches one level up once the score % 10 = 0.
